Requirements Document: Multi-Agent System for Slack
Version: 1.0
Date: June 2, 2025

1. Introduction
1.1 Project Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a multi-agent system designed to perform various information-based tasks. The system will be accessible via a Slack application, allowing users to interact with it conversationally. The core intelligence will be powered by the Gemini Large Language Model (LLM). The system will utilize Slack reactions to provide users with visual feedback on the tasks being performed.

1.2 Project Goals

To develop an intelligent multi-agent system capable of performing web searches, data retrieval, report generation, and data analysis (dashboard creation).

To integrate the system seamlessly with Slack, enabling users to interact with it through a familiar interface.

To leverage the Gemini LLM for natural language understanding, task execution, and response generation.

To provide intuitive user feedback through Slack reactions corresponding to agent activities.

To create a modular and extensible architecture that allows for future enhancements and the addition of new agent capabilities.

1.3 Target Audience

The primary users of this system will be individuals or teams within an organization who require quick access to information, automated report generation, and data-driven insights directly within their Slack workspace.

2. System Architecture Overview
2.1 Core Components

Slack Interface Agent: Manages communication between users on Slack and the core agent system. Responsible for receiving user requests, sending responses, and managing Slack reactions.

Orchestrator Agent: Receives tasks from the Slack Interface Agent, determines the appropriate specialized agent(s) to handle the task, and coordinates their execution.

Specialized Agents:

Web Search Agent: Performs web searches using specified search engines or APIs.

Data Retrieval Agent: Accesses and retrieves data from pre-defined data sources (e.g., databases, APIs, internal document repositories).

Report Generation Agent: Generates reports based on user-defined templates or parameters, using data provided by other agents or the user.

Analysis & Dashboard Agent: Analyzes data and generates informative dashboards or visualizations.

LLM Integration Layer (Gemini): Provides the natural language processing capabilities, reasoning, and content generation for all agents.

Knowledge Base/Memory: (Optional but recommended for complex tasks) Stores contextual information, past interactions, and learned preferences to improve performance and personalization.

Task Management & Queueing System: Manages the lifecycle of tasks, ensuring they are processed efficiently, especially for long-running operations.

2.2 Technology Stack (High-Level)

Backend: Python (recommended for AI/ML and agent development frameworks), Node.js (for Slack API interaction if preferred).

LLM: Google Gemini API.

Slack Integration: Slack Events API, Web API, and Interactive Components.

Data Storage: Relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) or NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB) for task management, user data, and potentially a knowledge base.

Dashboarding: Integration with a charting library (e.g., D3.js, Chart.js, Plotly) or a BI tool API if applicable.

Deployment: Cloud platform (e.g., Google Cloud, AWS, Azure) for scalability and reliability.
