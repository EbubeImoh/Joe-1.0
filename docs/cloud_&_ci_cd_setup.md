# Cloud & CI/CD Setup Guide for Zia-AI

This guide outlines the steps to set up cloud infrastructure and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for the Zia-AI project.

---

## 1. Select a Cloud Provider

Choose a cloud provider based on your team's preferences and requirements. Common options include:

- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**
- **Microsoft Azure**

---

## 2. Set Up Cloud Project/Environment

### Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
1. Create a new project in the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Enable required APIs (e.g., Compute Engine, Cloud Run, Secret Manager).
3. Set up billing and permissions for your team.

### AWS
1. Create a new AWS account or use an existing one.
2. Set up an IAM user/group with appropriate permissions.
3. Create a new project folder in AWS CodeCommit (optional).

### Azure
1. Create a new resource group in the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Set up required services (App Service, Key Vault, etc.).
3. Assign roles and permissions.

---

## 3. Prepare Application for Deployment

- Ensure your codebase is organized and requirements are listed in `requirements.txt`.
- Externalize all secrets and configuration using environment variables or a `.env` file.
- Add a production-ready web server (e.g., `uvicorn` for FastAPI).

---

## 4. Set Up Secrets Management

- **GCP:** Use [Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager).
- **AWS:** Use [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/).
- **Azure:** Use [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/key-vault/).

Store sensitive values such as:
- Slack tokens
- Gemini API key
- Database credentials

---

## 5. Configure CI/CD Pipeline

### Using GitHub Actions (Recommended)

1. Create a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file in your repo:

    ```yaml
    name: Deploy to Cloud

    on:
      push:
        branches: [ main ]

    jobs:
      build-and-deploy:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v3

        - name: Set up Python
          uses: actions/setup-python@v4
          with:
            python-version: '3.11'

        - name: Install dependencies
          run: |
            python -m pip install --upgrade pip
            pip install -r requirements.txt

        - name: Run tests
          run: |
            pytest

        # Add deployment steps for your cloud provider here
        # Example for GCP Cloud Run:
        # - name: Deploy to Cloud Run
        #   run: gcloud run deploy ...
    ```

2. Add cloud provider-specific deployment steps (see their documentation for details).

### Other CI/CD Options

- **GCP:** Cloud Build, Cloud Run, or App Engine
- **AWS:** CodePipeline, Elastic Beanstalk, ECS
- **Azure:** Azure Pipelines, App Service

---

## 6. Set Up Monitoring & Logging

- Enable logging and monitoring in your cloud provider's dashboard.
- Set up alerts for errors or downtime.

---

## 7. Test Deployment

- Deploy a test version of your app.
- Verify endpoints (e.g., `/`, `/slack/events`, `/slack/commands`) are accessible.
- Test Slack integration end-to-end.

---

## 8. Maintenance

- Regularly update dependencies and monitor for security patches.
- Back up databases and secrets.
- Review CI/CD logs and cloud monitoring dashboards.
