# Master Plan: Multi-Agent System for Slack (Zia-AI)

## 1. Project Overview

**Objective:**  
Develop a modular, scalable, and intelligent multi-agent system integrated with Slack, powered by the Gemini LLM, to automate web search, data retrieval, report generation, and data analysis tasks for organizational users.

## 3. Architecture & Technology Stack

### 3.1 High-Level Architecture

- **Slack Interface Agent:** Handles Slack events, messages, reactions, and interactive components.
- **Orchestrator Agent:** Receives user requests, decomposes tasks, delegates to specialized agents, aggregates results.
- **Specialized Agents:**
  - Web Search Agent
  - Data Retrieval Agent
  - Report Generation Agent
  - Analysis & Dashboard Agent
- **LLM Integration Layer:** Connects to Gemini API for NLU, summarization, and content generation.
- **Task Management System:** Tracks task status, manages queues, handles concurrency.
- **(Optional) Knowledge Base/Memory:** Stores context, preferences, and past interactions.
- **Data Storage:** For task logs, user data, and persistent memory.
- **Dashboarding/Visualization:** Generates and serves charts/images.

### 3.2 Technology Choices

- **Backend:** Python (primary), Node.js (optional for Slack API)
- **LLM:** Google Gemini API
- **Slack Integration:** Slack Events API, Web API, Interactive Components
- **Database:** PostgreSQL or MongoDB
- **Visualization:** Plotly, Matplotlib, or Chart.js (via image generation)
- **Deployment:** Google Cloud, AWS, or Azure
- **Secrets Management:** Cloud-native secrets manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager)

## 4. Detailed Implementation Plan

### 4.1 Phase 1: Planning & Setup

- Define detailed user stories and acceptance criteria.
- Set up version control (GitHub/GitLab).
- Register Slack app, configure permissions/scopes.
- Prepare cloud environment and CI/CD pipelines.

### 4.2 Phase 2: Core Infrastructure

- Scaffold backend project structure (modular, agent-based).
- Implement Slack event listener and message handler.
- Build Orchestrator skeleton for task routing.

### 4.3 Phase 3: Agent Implementation

#### 4.3.1 Web Search Agent
- Integrate with search APIs (Google, Bing, etc.).
- Summarize and format results for Slack.

#### 4.3.2 Data Retrieval Agent
- Connect to sample data sources (SQL, CSV, Google Sheets).
- Implement secure authentication and query handling.

#### 4.3.3 Report Generation Agent
- Accept data and templates.
- Generate reports in Markdown, PDF, or CSV.
- Use Gemini LLM for summarization.

#### 4.3.4 Analysis & Dashboard Agent
- Perform basic statistical analysis.
- Generate visualizations as images or links.
- Use Gemini LLM for insights.

### 4.4 Phase 4: LLM Integration

- Build Gemini API wrapper.
- Design and test prompts for each agent.
- Implement error handling and rate limiting.

### 4.5 Phase 5: Task Management & Queueing

- Implement task queue (e.g., Celery, RQ).
- Track task status, handle concurrency and long-running jobs.
- Store task logs in database.

### 4.6 Phase 6: User Feedback & Slack Reactions

- Map agent activities to Slack reactions (emojis).
- Implement interactive Slack elements (buttons, dropdowns).
- Provide progress updates and error notifications.

### 4.7 Phase 7: Testing & QA

- Write unit and integration tests for all components.
- Conduct load testing for concurrency.
- Perform user acceptance testing with sample users.

### 4.8 Phase 8: Deployment & Documentation

- Deploy to cloud platform with monitoring/logging.
- Write user and admin documentation.
- Prepare installation/configuration guides for Slack app.

---

## 5. Security & Compliance

- Enforce HTTPS for all API communications.
- Store credentials in a secure secrets manager.
- Implement input sanitization and validation.
- Restrict data access via permissions and roles.
- Regularly back up databases and logs.

---

## 6. Extensibility & Maintenance

- Design agents as independent, pluggable services.
- Externalize configuration (YAML/ENV files).
- Document codebase and APIs thoroughly.
- Plan for future agent additions and LLM upgrades.

---

## 7. Risk Management

- **Slack/Gemini API changes:** Monitor for updates, design abstraction layers.
- **Data source access:** Ensure permissions and fallback mechanisms.
- **LLM cost/latency:** Implement caching and prompt optimization.

---

## 8. Success Criteria

- Users can initiate and complete tasks via Slack with clear feedback.
- System handles at least 50 concurrent users and 20 requests/minute.
- All core agent functionalities are available and reliable.
- System is secure, maintainable, and extensible.

## 9. Next Steps

1. Review and refine user stories.
2. Assign roles and responsibilities.
3. Begin Phase 1: Planning & Setup.
